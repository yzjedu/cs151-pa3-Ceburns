* the objective of this lab was to gte more comfortable using functions for tasks. The steps I used were creating a list of the tasks I needed functions for, creating my code, and making sure it ran properly. My results did match what I expected to get. The challenged I encountered were figuring out how to properly format my deisgns and figuring out what my designs should be. I overcame these challmeges by tryign otu a few different designs and formats to see what worked and what did not work. I do think I learned what I was supposed to learn in this assignment. I like working by myself every once in a while because it gives me the chance to figure out the problems on my own which is challeneging but I feel like it helps me in the long run.
